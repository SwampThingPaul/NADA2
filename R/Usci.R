#' Interval-censored U-Score
#'
#' @description Interval-censored computation of uscores and their ranks for 1 parameter.  Called by uscoresi. Usci is not expected to be of much use to users on its own.
#' @param ylo The lower end of the concentration interval
#' @param yhi The upper end of the concentration interval
#' @param rnk A `TRUE`/`FALSE` variable on whether to compute the multivariate pattern on the uscores, or the ranks of the uscores.  Default is rnk=`TRUE`, use the ranks. rnk = `FALSE` returns the uscores.
#' @return Returns a single column of uscores or the ranks of uscores for a single pair of (low, high) interval-censored data columns.
