#' @description
#' Three MST markers of human-origin contamination, and three of animal contamination, were
#' evaluated along with a general fecal indicator to determine if the pattern of their
#' levels differed among five coastal sites off the coast of Florida. Data are interval-censored.
#'
#' Objective -- Test whether the pattern of six microbial source tracking (MST) markers
#' is related to the Entero1A indicator of general fecal pollution.  Also determine if the
#' pattern of markers plus Entero1A indicator differs among five coastal water sites using ANOSIM.
