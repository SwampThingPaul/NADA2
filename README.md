For many environmental professionals, the way to deal with “nondetects”
is less than obvious. Values below detection or reporting limits result
from measuring trace amounts of a variety of organic and inorganic
chemicals. This course presents up-to-date (maximum likelihood and
survival analysis) methods for computing summary statistics, hypothesis
tests, and regression for data with one or more detection limits.
Example problems are worked in class, so students can confidently take
these methods back to their office. The course assumes a knowledge of
basic statistics, including some familiarity with t-tests, linear
regression, and simple nonparametric tests like the rank-sum test.
