\title{Seasonal Kendall permutation test on censored data}
\usage{
censeaken(
  time,
  y,
  y.cen,
  group,
  LOG = FALSE,
  R = 4999,
  nmin = 4,
  seaplots = FALSE,
  printstat = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Column of the time variable, either a sequence of days or decimal times, etc.  Will be the scale used for time in the trend analysis.}

\item{y}{The column of y (response variable) values plus detection limits}

\item{y.cen}{The y-variable indicators, where 1 (or \code{TRUE}) indicates a detection limit in the \code{y.var} column, and 0 (or \code{FALSE}) indicates a detected value in \code{y.var}.}

\item{group}{Column of the season classifications. A factor in R, so usually though not necessarily a text variable.  If numeric, define as a factor before running the script.}

\item{LOG}{Indicator of whether to compute the trend analysis in the original y units, or on their logarithms.  The default is to use the logarithms (LOG = \code{TRUE}).  To compute in original units, specify the option LOG = \code{FALSE} (or LOG = 0).}

\item{R}{The number of repetitions in the permutation process.  R is often between 999 and 9999 (adding +1 to represent the observed test statistic produces 1000 to 10000 repetitions). By default R=4999. Increasing R results in lower variation in the p-values produced between runs.}

\item{nmin}{The minimum number of observations needed for the entire time period to be tested, per season.  For example, with 1 sample per year per season over an 8-year period, you have 8 observations for each season.  You can increase this number if you want a higher minimum.  Donâ€™t decrease it below the default of 4.  If there are fewer than nmin values that season is skipped and not included in the overall test and a note of this will be printed in the console.}

\item{seaplots}{In addition to the plot of the overall Seasonal Kendall trend line, plots of the trend in individual seasons can also be drawn.}

\item{printstat}{Logical \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} option of whether to print the resulting statistics in the console window, or not.  Default is \code{TRUE.}}
}
\value{
Prints the Kendall trend test results for each season individually. The overall Seasonal Kendall test and Theil-Sen line results are both printed and returned.

If \code{seaplots=TRUE} each season's trend line will be plotted seperately. A plot of the overall Seasonal Kendall (Akritas-Theil-Sen) line is always plotted.
If \code{seaplots=FALSE} only the overall Seasonal Kendall (Akritas-Theil-Sen) line will be plotted on a data scatterplot.
