\title{Peto-Peto one-factor test}
\usage{
cen1way(y1, y2, grp)
}
\arguments{
\item{y1}{The column of data values plus detection limits}

\item{y2}{The column of indicators, where 1 (or \code{TRUE}) indicates a detection limit in the y1 column, and 0 (or \code{FALSE}) indicates a detected value in y1.}

\item{grp}{Grouping or factor variable. Can be either a text or numeric value indicating the group assignment.}
}
\value{
A list of summary statistics for each group evaluated containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{N} Number of samples
\item \code{PctND} Percentage of non-detects
\item \code{KMmean} Kaplan-Meier estimate of the mean
\item \code{KMsd} Kaplan-Meier estimate of standard deviation
\item \code{KMmedian} Kaplan-Meier estmate of the median
}

Peto-Peto test results including Chi-Squared value, degrees of freedom and \code{p-value} of the test.

If more than two groups, \code{p-values} of the pairwise multiple comparisons, adjusted using the BH false-discovery rate, are reported.
}
\description{
Performs a Peto-Peto nonparametric test of differences in cdfs between groups.  If more than two groups, the test is followed by a nonparametric multiple comparison test.  Uses the BH method of adjusting p-values.
