\title{Censored data t-test}
\usage{
cen2means(y1, y2, grp, LOG = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y1}{The column of data values plus detection limits}

\item{y2}{The column of indicators, where 1 (or \code{TRUE}) indicates a detection limit in the y1 column, and 0 (or \code{FALSE}) indicates a detected value in y1.}

\item{grp}{Grouping or factor variable. Can be either a text or numeric value indicating the group assignment.}

\item{LOG}{Indicator of whether to compute tests in the original units, or on their logarithms.  The default is to use the logarithms (LOG = \code{TRUE}).  To compute in original units, specify the option LOG = \code{FALSE} (or LOG = 0).}

\value{
Draw and Q-Q Plot with Shapiro-Francia test for normality W and p-values, Censored data analogue of the t-test

Returns the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) t-test results including Chi-Squared value, degrees of freedom and \code{p-value} of the test.
}
\description{
Performs a parametric test of differences in means between two groups of censored data, either in original or in log units (the latter becomes a test for difference in geometric means).
}
\details{
Note that because this is an MLE procedure, when a normal distribution model is used (LOG=FALSE) values may be modeled as below zero.  When this happens the p-values may be unreal (often lower than they should be).  Because of this, testing in log units is preferable and the default.
