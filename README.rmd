## Introduction
For many environmental professionals, the way to deal with “nondetects” is less than obvious. Values below detection or reporting limits result from measuring trace amounts of a variety of organic and inorganic chemicals. This package includes methods for plotting, computing summary statistics, hypothesis tests, and regression models for data with one or more detection limits. Most are adaptations of or direct use of existing methods found in survival analysis (such as in the survival package) and in cancer research (such as in the interval package).

This package includes functions from the `NADA` package and includes a series of new procedures and/or improvements to prior functions developed through a series of webinars, online courses, and updates to Helsel (2004) and Helsel (2011).
